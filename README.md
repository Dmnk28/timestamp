# Timestamp Microservice

This Timestamp Microservice provides a conversion from unix to utc time and vice versa. You can use it for converting only, or if you need work with both formats in your application and save some time

Since this is a freeCodeCamp-Project of mine its limited in functionality to the tasks demanded by the corresponding [certification project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/timestamp-microservice).

Try my solution by using one of the following paths
* ".../api/<unix-Time to convert>" like [.../api/0](https://timestamp.dmnk28.repl.co/api/2022-03-26)
* ".../api/<utc-date to convert>" like [.../api/2022-03-26](https://timestamp.dmnk28.repl.co/api/2022-03-26)

Alternatively feel free to use any date you have in mind or use [.../api/](https://timestamp.dmnk28.repl.co/api/) to get the an Timestamp of the current moment :)
